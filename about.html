          <p>My name is Jessica and I have been creating for as long as I can remember. I started out when taking art and photography classes when I was in high school. While it was my plan to go to art school right out of high school, things did not play out that way. I kept art in my life but only really as a hobby that I did when I felt I was in the mood. It has remained an outlet for me my entire life.
          <br>
          Recently, COVID took over and I also had my 3rd baby. I lost my job due to COVID but while at home, I took a step back into the creative world, making things like resin creations and customized tumblers. With that, I tried to figure out what it was that I really wanted to do, so I joined a coding class because I wanted to sell the things I was making and I figured I'll learn some coding and make my own website to sell my things. Well that just opened up another door that I was not prepared for but so glad that it did. 
          <br>
          Now I am a Quality Assurance Apprentice and still taking coding classes to continue learning all that I can. My 2 boys, my daughter and my spouse are my WHY.
